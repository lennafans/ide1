        This infographic contains an abundance of information. It is able to
        capture both the destinction between municipality/region elections,
        geographical dispersion and vote distribution. Using a map to display
        the actual municipalities and colour codes to signal the overall results
        of the individual locations, without the user having to navigate into
        details. By clicking and interacting on the map, a view
        of regions, municipalities and later constituencies, explains the vote
        distribution with a high degree of detail. Especially the historical
        comparison (percentage- and candidate-wise) is useful for putting the
        information in context. On the negative side it contains a lot of
        information that inevitable is confusing to navigate. It is also a
        little sluggish, discouraging the user to thoroughly interact with all
        levels in the visualisation.

        This website uses visualization to explain some of the main concepts
        in machine learning in a simple and intuitive way. The whole page works
        as an interactive visualization where the information changes as the reader
        scrolls through the page. While some of the effects might seem a bit excessive, especially for people with
        a background in machine learning, the information they convey through the animations is much more intuitive
        than had it been explained in plain text and inactive graphs.


        Since the target audience is most likely people with little or no knowledge of machine learning, this visualizatio

    <p>I work with neuromorphic computation and machine learning, and through
    that data with a high degree of complexity. I often get the feeling that
    I miss important correlations and hard-to-see causalities, simply because
    the data is difficult to intuit about. Focusing on the neuromorphic part,
    I would get the data from different
    <a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/3dmodeldb/">3d model datasets</a>
    and the Human Brain Project, who are currently storing terrabytes of data
    on neural connections and neural models of humans, rats and mice.</p>
    <p>To begin with it would be interesting to visualise some of the
    connections of the different brain modules, to underline
    the complexity of the domain. The story of such a visualisation would focus
    on giving the user an understanding of the diffent areas of the brain, how
    they are connected and potentially how they work. This would bring some
    of the at times inaccessible information to a broader audience. But the
    primary audience would be the researchers associated with the project, to
    help them visualising information to shed light on otherwise hidden
    aspects of the data.</p>

    <p>This first prototype takes the <code>.stl</code> file and imports it
    using threejs. The model is downloaded from the
    <a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/3dmodeldb/showmodel?model=155977">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/3dmodeldb</a>
    database and describes an Olfactory bulb mitral cell microcurcuit in a rat.
