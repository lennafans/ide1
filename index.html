        This infographic contains an abundance of information. It is able to
        capture both the destinction between municipality/region elections,
        geographical dispersion and vote distribution. Using a map to display
        the actual municipalities and colour codes to signal the overall results
        of the individual locations, without the user having to navigate into
        details. By clicking and interacting on the map, a view
        of regions, municipalities and later constituencies, explains the vote
        distribution with a high degree of detail. Especially the historical
        comparison (percentage- and candidate-wise) is useful for putting the
        information in context. On the negative side it contains a lot of
        information that inevitable is confusing to navigate. It is also a
        little sluggish, discouraging the user to thoroughly interact with all
        levels in the visualisation.

      <li><a href="http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/">A visual introduction to machine learning</a>.<br/>
        This website uses visualization to explain some of the main concepts
        in machine learning in a simple and intuitive way. The whole page works
        as an interactive visualization where the information changes as the reader
        scrolls through the page. While some of the effects might seem a bit excessive,
        the animations help convey some rather complex ideas and concepts in an intuitive
        and interactive way.Since the target audience is most likely people with little or
        no knowledge of machine learning, the website might benefit from being even more
        interactive. For example letting the user change some of the variables in the process
        would provide a better experience through hands-on experience with the area.
        But again, more interactivity might also clutter the visualization and make
        the experience more confusing.

    <h2>Dan Graakj√¶r</h2>
    <p>My area of study and interest lies mainly within the field of machine learning.
      This means that a lot of the projects i work with is very data heavy, both with regards
    to quantity but also when it comes to the amount of work and focus on preprocessing steps
    and analysis. A lot of this work will benefit greatly from using visualization as a tool
    for me to gain insight into the data I'm working with, keep track of the data transformations
    throughout the data processing and also analyze the results afterwards. Furthermore visualization
    is also great for conveying some of the findings in this area. A lot of the concepts are complex and
    technical in nature, and visual representations will greatly reduce the difficulty of grasping these
    concepts (For example the intro to machine learning above).
    Another great example of how the visualization can help convey different types of data,
    different data transformations can be seen at the
      <a href="http://playground.tensorflow.org">tensorflow website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Jens Egholm</h2>
    <p>I work with neuromorphic computation and machine learning, and through
    that data with a high degree of complexity. I often get the feeling that
    I miss important correlations and hard-to-see causalities, simply because
    the data is difficult to intuit about. Focusing on the neuromorphic part,
    I would get the data from different
    <a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/3dmodeldb/">3d model datasets</a>
    and the Human Brain Project, who are currently storing terrabytes of data
    on neural connections and neural models of humans, rats and mice.</p>
    <p>To begin with it would be interestconfusinging to visualise some of the
    connections of the different brain modules, to underline
    the complexity of the domain. The story of such a visualisation would focus
    on giving the user an understanding of the diffent areas of the brain, how
    they are connected and potentially how they work. This would bring some
    of the at times inaccessible information to a broader audience. But the
    primary audience would be the researchers associated with the project, to
    help them visualising information to shed light on otherwise hidden
    aspects of the data.</p>
    <p>Prototype at <a href="neuron.html">neuron.html<a></p>
    <p>This first prototype takes the <code>.stl</code> file and imports it
    using threejs. The model is downloaded from the
    <a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/3dmodeldb/showmodel?model=155977">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/3dmodeldb</a>
    database and describes an Olfactory bulb mitral cell microcurcuit in a rat.
